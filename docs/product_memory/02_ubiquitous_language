### Ubiquitous Language

#### 1. Purpose
Defines the shared, internal vocabulary that both human team members and the AI use when discussing the product. By capturing terms, acronyms, and definitions in a single, version‑controlled file, the AI can resolve ambiguous references and keep the conversation grounded in a common understanding.

#### 2. Structure

# Ubiquitous Language

## Terms
| Term | Definition | Example usage |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Gamme ** |...|...|
| **Produit ** |...|...|
| **Flavor** |...|...|

## Acronyms
| Acronym | Full form | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **RAG** | Retrieval Augmented Generation | a technology that connects generative AI models to internal company databases |
| **MCP** | Mode Context Protocol | The MCP protocol creates a standardized bidirectional connection for AI applications, allowing LLMs to easily connect to multiple data sources and tools |

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Consistency** – Use the exact term as listed whenever referring to that concept in prompts or documentation.
2. **Context** – Prefix the term with its bounded context when necessary, e.g., *[Order] Payment*.
3. **Abbreviations** – When using an acronym, first spell out and then provide the acronym in parentheses.
4. **Versioning** – Tag each change to the file with a clear commit message: `docs: update upon product on‑boarding meeting`.

#### 3. Example Prompt Using the Ubiquitous Language
```text
[Context:Order] [Intent:Explain] What is the role of the Payment Processor in the Order Bounded Context?
```
*The AI reads the Ubiquitous Language file, identifies `Payment Processor` as a term within the `Order` context, and returns a precise answer.*
