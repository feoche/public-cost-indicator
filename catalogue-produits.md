preservation (Cold data)
Some data must be retained for years or decades , even if it is
rarely, or never, accessed . Regulatory archives, historical
records, and disaster recovery copies fall into this category .
Backups and business data retention
(Warm data)
As data ages, access frequency drops. Operational backups,
historical business records, and compliance datasets are still

Cloud applications and active data

Modern applications, APIs, and digital services generate data
